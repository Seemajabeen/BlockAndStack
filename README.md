## Smart Contract

The FitCoin smart contract is written in Move language for Aptos blockchain:

### Key Functions

- `record_activity()` - Record fitness activity and earn FitCoins
- `purchase_item()` - Purchase marketplace items with FitCoins
- `get_user_profile()` - View user data from blockchain
- `get_fitcoin_balance()` - Check FitCoin balance

### Contract Address
- Testnet: `0x42` (placeholder - replace with actual deployed address)

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Aptos Wallet Adapter for Web3 integration
- Lucide React for icons

### Blockchain
- Aptos blockchain (Testnet)
- Move smart contracts
- Aptos TypeScript SDK
- Petra & Martian wallet support

### Supported Wallets
- Petra Wallet
- Martian Wallet
- Any Aptos-compatible wallet

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Aptos CLI (for contract deployment)
- Supported Aptos wallet (Petra/Martian)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd fitcoin-web3
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Smart Contract Deployment

1. Install Aptos CLI
```bash
curl -fsSL "https://aptos.dev/scripts/install_cli.py" | python3
```

2. Initialize Aptos account
```bash
aptos init
```

3. Deploy contract
```bash
cd contracts
aptos move publish --named-addresses fitcoin_addr=<your-address>
```

4. Update contract address in `src/services/blockchain.ts`

## How It Works

### 1. Wallet Connection
- User connects their Aptos wallet (Petra/Martian)
- App checks if user is registered on blockchain
- New users complete on-chain registration

### 2. Activity Tracking
- Start activity tracking in the app
- Real-time calorie calculation
- Stop tracking submits transaction to blockchain
- Smart contract mints FitCoins based on calories burned

### 3. Marketplace
- Browse available items (insurance, ads, eco-projects)
- Purchase with FitCoins
- Transaction recorded on blockchain
- Real-world benefits activated

### 4. Profile & History
- All data stored on Aptos blockchain
- View activity history and achievements
- Check FitCoin balance and transaction history
- Decentralized data ownership
